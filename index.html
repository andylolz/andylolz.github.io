#### Transparency / Civic tech

 * I volunteer with [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/). Recently, I’ve been having fun contributing to [YourNextMP](https://yournextmp.com/).
 * I enjoy writing scrapers for [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/), and regularly attend their [#FlashHacks](http://www.meetup.com/London-Open-Data-Missions/) events. I’ll happily help you write a scraper to make some public financial data machine-readable.
 * I love the work of [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/), and have contributed little bits of code to [FixMyStreet](https://www.fixmystreet.com/), [TheyWorkForYou](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/) and [ParlParse](http://parser.theyworkforyou.com/).
 * I’ve helped build plenty of stuff at [Rewired State](http://www.rewiredstate.org/) hacks. I think my favourite is the [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org/).
 * I used to help organise London [Open Data Maker Nights](http://okfnlabs.org/events/open-data-maker/). They’re informal meetups where we build apps and generate insights from open data. I’m also an [Open Knowledge Labs](http://okfnlabs.org/) lead.

#### Data Science

 * I was an ambassador at a recent [DataKind UK](http://datakind.org.uk) hack (using data to help charities work better). Here’s [a blog about the tool I helped build](http://www.datakind.org/projects/communicating-about-child-poverty/) for the [North East Child Poverty Commission](http://www.nechildpoverty.org.uk/).

#### Education

 * I run a [Code Club](http://codeclub.org.uk) at [Moreland Primary School](http://www.moreland-islington.co.uk/), Islington. Here are [some of the Scratch project we’ve made](http://scratch.mit.edu/users/moreland-school/).
 * I’ve contributed a lot of code to Code Club’s open source repos. [I blogged about some work I did](https://gist.github.com/andylolz/717626137848f2e185f9) to help auto-generate printed lesson material, and automate the build process.

#### Running about

 * I’m a keen member of [GoodGym](http://www.goodgym.org) – a running club that helps local community projects with physical tasks. [GoodGym does other stuff, too!](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/video/2014/jun/26/ideal-fit-goodgym-combining-exercise-good-deeds-video)
 * I run (and sometimes volunteer) at [Mile End Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/mileend/) (a free 5km run on Saturday mornings). There’s [probably one near you](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/events/events/).

#### Environmental campaigning

 * I used to work as a dev for social justice NGO [Avaaz.org](http://www.avaaz.org).
 * Before that, I worked for climate change campaign [10:10](http://www.1010global.org/uk). I worked on projects like [Solar Schools](http://www.solarschools.org.uk) (crowd-funding solar panels for schools) and [Lighter Later](http://www.lighterlater.org) (a policy campaign to put UK clocks forward an hour).
 * In 2009, I cycled around Wales, performing a play and running workshops to promote sustainability with [The Otesha Project](http://www.otesha.org.uk/). It was ace.
 * I eat fish. I don’t eat other animals. I also [try not to fly](https://twitter.com/andylolz/status/559653464419340288). At some point, I’ll add some compelling links here explaining why.

#### Other stuff

 * I’ve been attending the London [Sunday Assembly](http://sundayassembly.com/) since it started. I’ve recently joined their craft club.
 * I support [Bristol City FC](http://www.bcfc.co.uk/).
 * I studied Engineering at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and Computer Science at [ČVUT](https://www.cvut.cz/), Prague.
