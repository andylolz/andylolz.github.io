# Where does this draft end up?

Weirdly, the date gets ignored… The new folder structure appears to be based on the published date.

So while I’d have expected this blog to have ended up at `/2011/12/31/this-is-a-test.html`, it has instead ended up at `/2015/07/08/2011-12-31-this-is-a-test.html`. Wat?
