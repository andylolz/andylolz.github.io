# Welcome to Code Club!

Today, let’s have a go publishing our own news stories on the web!

### How do websites work?

 * On this page, try clicking View -> Developer -> View Source. Can you understand it?
 * It’s called “HTML”. That’s the language Chrome (and other web browsers) understand.
 * Try doing the same thing on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround" target="_blank">the newsround website</a>. What do you think?

### Can I have a webpage please?

Here’s how the HTML gets to your computer.

### Put on your X-Ray Goggles!

 * Because HTML is just some text, we can change it and save it.
 * Open <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/goggles" target="_blank">X-Ray Goggles</a> and follow the instructions on the page. Can you change the background?
 * Try changing some text on the page, too.

### Get set up…

 * Log in by clicking “Sign In”, then “log in with Persona”, then enter: **morelandschool@gmail.com** (the password is the usual one!)
 * Then <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/goggles/install" target="_blank">add X-Ray Goggles to Chrome by going here</a> and dragging the yellow bookmarklet to the bookmark bar. Ask Andy if you get stuck!

### Time to make some news!

 * Earlier this month, David Cameron won the general election. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/32646663" target="_blank">Here’s a news story about it.</a>
 * Can you use X-Ray goggles to change this news story, so it’s about your school elections?
 * <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/32646663" target="_blank">Go to the page</a>, click the bookmarklet, and then change the news!
 * When you are done, click Publish to save your new version.
